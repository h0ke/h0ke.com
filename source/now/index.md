#### What am I doing now?

That's a great question! This idea was *borrowed* from [Derek Sivers](https://sivers.org/nowff). I'm spending my time...

* being the father of a [small human](http://lucashokanson.com).

* as an engineering manager at [Spotify](https://www.spotify.com).

* reading [a few books](https://www.goodreads.com/h0ke).

* [listening](http://www.merlinmann.com/roderick) [to](http://www.radiolab.org/) [a](http://www.npr.org/sections/codeswitch/) [few](https://www.wnyc.org/shows/deathsexmoney) [podcasts](http://99percentinvisible.org/).
