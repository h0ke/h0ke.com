#### What am I doing now?

That's a great question! This idea was *borrowed* from [Derek Sivers](https://sivers.org/nowff). I'm spending my time...

* being the father of [small](http://lucashokanson.com) [people](http://nadinehokanson.com).

* as an engineer at [Spotify](https://www.spotify.com).

* reading [a few books](https://www.goodreads.com/h0ke).

* [listening](https://gimletmedia.com/shows/howtosaveaplanet) [to](https://www.gimletmedia.com/reply-all) [a](http://www.npr.org/sections/codeswitch/) [few](https://samharris.org/podcast/) [podcasts](http://www.sceneonradio.org/).
