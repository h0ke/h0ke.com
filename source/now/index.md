#### What am I doing now?

That's a great question! This idea was *borrowed* from [Derek Sivers](https://sivers.org/nowff). I'm spending my time...

* being the father of a [small human](http://lucashokanson.com).

* as a data engineer at [Spotify](https://www.spotify.com).

* reading [*The Inevitable* by Kevin Kelly](http://kk.org/books/the-inevitable/).

* [listening](http://www.merlinmann.com/roderick) [to](http://zenparentingradio.com/) [way](https://www.showaboutrace.com/) [too](http://5by5.tv/roadwork) [many](https://www.relay.fm/rd) [podcasts](http://dobyfriday.com/).
