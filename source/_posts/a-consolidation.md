i've always been bothered by the fact that i've shut down old blogs instead of carrying over the content. not that any of the writing was amazing or particularly insightful, but I enjoy seeing _other_ bloggers' progress through time. 

so, i've decided to pull in some old blog posts from blogs long gone including early iterations of h0ke.com, thehokie.com, incessantrambling.com and a recently decommissioned tumblr site.

there's way too much content to add all at once, so it'll be more like a slow, archival project.
