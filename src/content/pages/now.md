#### What am I doing now?

That's a great question! This idea was *borrowed* from [Derek Sivers](https://sivers.org/nowff). I'm spending my time...

* being the father of a [tiny human](http://lucashokanson.com).

* as the engineering lead helping maintain [Preact](http://www.preact.com) and build [Ptero](http://www.pterohq.com).

* working on a prototype for a [vacation days tracker](https://github.com/scarow/pto-tracker).

* learning how [serverless](https://github.com/serverless/serverless) works to build [30 Day Delay](http://30daydelay.com/).

* currently reading *Thinking, Fast and Slow* by Daniel Kahneman.

* listening to way too many podcasts.
