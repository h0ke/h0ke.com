Several folks were quick to remind me that small sticky fingers were hard to unravel from a beard and baby puke didn't wash out easily. Once I started seriously contemplating trimming a few (9) inches off the bottom, the pros and cons lined up accordingly:\n\n**Pros**\n\n- Small sticky toes (not fingers) wouldn’t get caught in it\n- It wouldn’t catch fire when reaching across our new gas range\n- People would stop asking me how long I've been growing it\n- Most importantly, I wouldn’t end up cutting it in a fit of rage, leading to perhaps too many inches removed\n\n**Cons**\n\n- People might react negatively to my decision\n- The realization that I was sort of attached to all five years of growth\n\nOne night I finally decided to do it.

The paradox being that while we think more choice is the path to happiness, it is, in fact, the opposite. During the selection process, there is much anxiety. Immediately after choosing, a whole other flood of emotions arrives. After a while of this pattern, there can even be an other set of emotions that precede needing to make a choice.</p>\n<p>Though there are several areas of my life that were improved by this, such as clothes shopping, ordering food at a restaurant stands out. One of the reasons most people go out to eat is to relax with friends or family and avoid cooking at home. So it’s odd that the meal selections process is so fraught with tension. Nowadays, when I’m seated in front of a menu, I scan all the sections and pick two things that I’ll enjoy. When the server arrives, I’ll pick one and be done with it. I don’t experience much “buyers remorse” because I’ve slimmed my options down to two.</p>\n<p>This topic resurfaced for me because I’ve recently started a weekly tradition of taking an hour and getting lunch out by myself. My restaurant of choice is a vegan Tibetan restaurant. They keep it simple, as though you’re getting a meal in a Tibetan temple. Every day there is a new menu, following the same themes. You order either a medium or large plate<sup id=\"fnref:1\"><a href=\"#fn:1\" rel=\"footnote\">1</a></sup>. All plates come with a bean/lentil soup to start. Tea and water are available for self service. There is also beer, wine and desserts. That’s it.</p>\n<p>Last weekend I found myself enjoying a medium plate and cup of Kukicha Twig tea when an older couple came into the restaurant. The man working the front of house knows that this is an atypical dining experience, so he explained the system. Once he was done with the run down, the couple immediately asked, “Can I get it without the soup and extra greens?” The employee explained that yes, but the extra greens would cost more. “And what about this unseasoned plate,” she asked? He told her that it was like the normal meal, but with no seasoning.</p>\n<p>“Should we get a medium or large plate to split between the two of us?” </p>\n<p>“What is your wine selection? Do you have beer?”</p>\n<p>“Is there more seating out back or is this it?”</p>\n<p>The questions kept pouring from the diners and the patient server answered all of them in stride. It was clear that they meant no harm. The reason it stood out is a majority of people enter the restaurant, say hello and request “2 medium” or “1 large, thanks.” Even in a restaurant that has pared down the potential options, people do everything they can dive head first into the paradox of choice.</p>\n<div id=\"footnotes\"><hr><div id=\"footnotelist\"><ol style=\"list-style:none; padding-left: 0;\"><li id=\"fn:1\"><span style=\"display: inline-block; vertical-align: top; padding-right: 10px;\">1.</span><span style=\"display: inline-block; vertical-align: top;\">There is also a smaller, unseasoned plate for those who are spice averse.</span><a href=\"#fnref:1\" rev=\"footnote\"> ↩</a></li></ol></div></div>"},{"title":"decluttering","date":"2016-04-17T07:00:00.000Z","subtitle":"stuff, stuff, stuff, and more stuff.","_content":"Over the last six months, my family has embarked on a decluttering journey.

I've tried. I really have. When I was young, I would spend entire summer days in a friend’s basement playing SimCity, Doom and all the other great games of the 90s. Even then, once summer sessions started for soccer, I would haul out of the basement, grab my gear and run to the field.\n\nThroughout high school, I didn't play video games. There was a brief stint of playing Dungeons & Dragons, but that was only when it was too hot or rainy to play street hockey.\n\nOnce I got to college, the only draw to video games was the blazing fast campus network. Most of my focus on Unreal Tournament and Counterstrike was fed by being surrounded by other people who were also avoiding work.

I have <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%40h0ke%20pants&amp;src=typd\">thoughts on pants</a>.</p>\n<p>My body type can be best described as ‘husky,’ to use the early ‘90s parlance. While I wish clothing manafaturers would cut pants that fit me, I totally understand that my proportions are not… average.</p>\n<p>Here’s the problem:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If I get the right waist measurement, the inseam and rise are too long.</li>\n<li>If I get the correct inseam and rise, I can <em>maybe</em> fit my left quad into the waist.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This has been my reality to date.</p>\n<p>A couple years ago, the Gap started making a 34 in. waist pant that fits me less terribly than any other non-custom pant. The inseam is a bit long at 30 in. and the rise provides a look best described as “saggy britches.” However, I’ll take what I can get and ameliorate the situation using a sturdy belt and rolled cuffs. <sup id=\"fnref:1\"><a href=\"#fn:1\" rel=\"footnote\">1</a></sup></p>\n<p>Over the last month, I decided something had to change. In pondering what could be done, I remembered a podcast from late last year. It was an episode of freakanomics called, “<a href=\"http://freakonomics.com/podcast/how-did-the-belt-win-a-new-freakonomics-radio-episode/\">How Did the Belt Win?</a>“ </p>\n<p>The main thread (see what I did there) was that belts and suspenders have gone back in forth as the dominant leader in the “plumber’s crack avoidence” market.There is talk of fashion trends, wedgie avoidal, monarchical mandate, sword belts, modern social norms and even concerns of cutting into the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve like a tourniquet.</p>\n<p>With this in mind, I decided to give suspenders a go, social norms be damned. I picked a <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00NUZTVXO?tag=30daydel-20\">relatively cheap pair</a> for the experiment, and waited for the two days shipping (#firstnerdproblems)</p>\n<p>Once they arrived, I quickly tried them on. Lo and behold: They looked <strong>ridiculous</strong>.</p>\n<p>The suspenders accentuated my dad gut and placed the waistline of the pants roughly two inches higher than normal.</p>\n<p>After taking a deep breath, I realized that the higher waistline actually provided the pant fit I was looking for. The hem of my pants fell where I wanted and the “saggy britches” morphed into “there might be an ass in there.” The suspenders actually made these untailored, readily available pants fit.</p>\n<p>Ok, but what to do about the whole upper half of my wardrobe making me look like an over-fed mountain dwarf?</p>\n<p>The solution unvailed an unintended benefit of the suspender experiment. It was decided I was to wear a decent sweater or button down shirt to cover the suspenders. Now I had a decent top and pants that fit! If only my mother could see me now! <sup id=\"fnref:2\"><a href=\"#fn:2\" rel=\"footnote\">2</a></sup></p>\n<p>I’ve always rejected the notion that dressing well impacts your mood.
